import { PackageManagerTabs } from 'rspress/theme';

# Quick Start

## Installation

<PackageManagerTabs command="install ts-regex-builder" />

## Basic usage

```js
import { buildRegExp, capture, oneOrMore } from 'ts-regex-builder';

// /Hello (\w+)/
const regex = buildRegExp(['Hello ', capture(oneOrMore(word))]);
```

## Performance

Regular expressions created with this library are executed at runtime, so you should avoid creating them in a context where they would need to be executed multiple times, e.g., inside loops or functions. We recommend that you create a top-level object for each required regex.
